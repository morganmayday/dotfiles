      label: What caused the crash
      description: |
        Any information likely to help debug the crash. What were you doing when the crash occurred,
        what changes did you make, can you get it to happen again?
  - type: textarea
    id: dump
    attributes:
      label: Minidump
      description: |
        Attach `minidump.dmp.log` here. If it is too big to upload, compress it.

        You may skip this step if quickshell crashed while processing a password
        or other sensitive information. If you skipped it write why instead.
    validations:
        required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: logs
    attributes:
      label: Log file
      description: |
        Attach `log.qslog.log` here. If it is too big to upload, compress it.

        You can preview the log if you'd like using `quickshell read-log <path-to-log>`.
    validations:
        required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: config
    attributes:
      label: Configuration
      description: |
        Attach your configuration here, preferrably in full (not just one file).
        Compress it into a zip, tar, etc.

        This will help us reproduce the crash ourselves.
  - type: textarea
    id: bt
    attributes:
      label: Backtrace
      description: |
        If you have gdb installed and use systemd, or otherwise know how to get a backtrace,
        we would appreciate one. (You may have gdb installed without knowing it)

        1. Run `coredumpctl debug <pid>` where `pid` is the number shown after "Crashed process ID"
        in the crash reporter.
        2. Once it loads, type `bt -full` (then enter)
        3. Copy the output and attach it as a file or in a spoiler.
  - type: textarea
    id: exe
    attributes:
      label: Executable
      description: |
        If the crash folder contains a executable.txt file, upload it here. If not you can ignore this field.
        If it is too big to upload, compress it.

        Note: executable.txt is the quickshell binary. It has a .txt extension due to github's limitations on
        filetypes.
